          <p>Hello, I’m Saaya Fukuoka, currently studying at UC San Diego.
          I love learning different languages.
          Having lived in Japan, the U.S., and France, I’ve expanded my world through experiencing diverse cultures.
          Moving forward, I hope to cherish small moments of joy and keep embracing new challenges.</p>

            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Saaya Fukuoka.</p>
            <p>
              I am currently majoring in Applied Mathematics at UC San Diego, while also focusing on Data Science and Computer Science. Initially, I was interested in medicine, but an experience during my study abroad in France made me realize that data has the potential to protect lives and improve daily living. Since then, I have been drawn to the idea of contributing to society through the power of mathematics and data.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills by applying my knowledge of machine learning and statistical modeling to real-world data.<br>Having lived in Japan, France, and the U.S., I have also developed strong cross-cultural communication skills and the ability to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, I hope to continue deepening my learning by focusing not only on the numbers, but also on the human stories and behaviors behind the data.

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>I enjoy helping others. In Seattle, U.S., I served as an event coordinator and university ambassador for JIA’s Coming-of-Age Ceremony. Last year, about 130 participants attended; this year, over 300. I was responsible for venue setup, registration management, and volunteer coordination and supervision.</p>

            <h3>Internship</h3>
            <p>I currently work as a long-term engineering intern at a SaaS company in the beauty-tech field, contributing to backend API development and code reviews using clean architecture. Through this role, I apply and deepen my skills in software design, team collaboration, and scalable system development.</p>

            <h3>Hobby</h3>
            <p>On my days off, I enjoy visiting ramen shops, and tonkatsu restaurants. I also love learning languages—speaking in someone's native language often changes their expression and makes them open up, which motivates me to keep learning. I speak Japanese, English, and French, and I’m currently studying Chinese.</p>
